We use Activity Diagrams to illustrate the flow of control in a system and refer to the steps involved in the execution of a use case. We model sequential and concurrent activities using activity diagrams. So, we basically depict workflows visually using an activity diagram. An activity diagram focuses on condition of flow and the sequence in which it happens. We describe or depict what causes a particular event using an activity diagram.

UML models basically three types of diagrams, namely, structure diagrams, interaction diagrams, and behavior diagrams. An activity diagram is a behavioral diagram i.e. it depicts the behavior of a system.

An activity diagram portrays the control flow from a start point to a finish point showing the various decision paths that exist while the activity is being executed. We can depict both sequential processing and concurrent processing of activities using an activity diagram. They are used in business and process modelling where their primary use is to depict the dynamic aspects of a system.

An activity diagram is very similar to a flowchart. So let us understand if an activity diagrams or a flowcharts are any different
